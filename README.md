Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) has become increasingly popular, especially in applications involving wearable sensors, smartphones, and smart home devices. CNNs excel in HAR tasks due to their ability to learn spatial hierarchies and automatically extract features from raw sensor data, which often includes accelerometer, gyroscope, or other time-series signals.
