Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks is a method of identifying and classifying human activities from sensor data. LSTM networks, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), are particularly suited for this task due to their ability to learn and remember temporal dependencies over long sequences of data, which is essential for capturing the dynamic nature of human movements.
